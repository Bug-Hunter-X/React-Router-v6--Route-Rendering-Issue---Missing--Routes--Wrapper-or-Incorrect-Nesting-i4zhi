```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        {/* ... other routes ... */}
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```
This corrected code ensures that all routes are nested within the `<Routes>` component.  This is crucial for React Router v6 to function correctly.  No routes should be placed directly within the `BrowserRouter` without being wrapped in `<Routes>`.
